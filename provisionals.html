    <h1>Provisional Sums</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Electrical Specification</li>
      <li>Electrical Fittings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Provisional sums can be defined or undefined sums in the construction contract and is a way to deal with cost items which may not be known or specified at the time of the initial budget planning. Contingency provision is an example of a provisional sum. It is a useful way to share risk between the client and contractor. In the electrical section a provisional sum might be for a home automation, security or a lighting and sound system.</p>
    <p>If something like this is on your wish list, then ask your DGA Quantity Surveyor for a guide price until you get a reliable quotation from a contractor.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Electrical Specification</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>NHBC Required</li>
      <li>Mid Range</li>
      <li>Super Home</li>
    </ul>
    <p>DGA would always advise asking your architect for an electrical layout drawing so that the specification can be worked up early. Changes during the project or at the end including socket and switch positions and numbers can be disproportionately expensive.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>NHBC Required</h3>
    <p>Basic specification - low cost. This is the entry level safe specification provided by NHBC. Here is an example of what this level of specification would include.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Mid Range</h3>
    <p>Mid range electrical layouts. This specification would allow for a more sophisticated wiring design with perhaps underfloor heating or some level of home automations and AV systems.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Super Home</h3>
    <p>This top of the range specification would be capable of supporting technology for controlled heating, air conditioning, lighting, security and audio visual systems.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Electrical Fittings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>White Plastic (MK)</li>
      <li>Chrome / Stainless Steel (MK)</li>
      <li>Forbes And Lomax</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>White Plastic (MK)</h3>
    <p>Basic specification - low cost.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Chrome / Stainless Steel (MK)</h3>
    <p>Mid range - Chrome or Steel.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Forbes And Lomax</h3>
    <p>Heritage or designer ranges e.g. From the Anvil or Forbes and Lomax.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Exterior Options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Brickwork</li>
      <li>Stonework</li>
      <li>Render</li>
      <li>Roof Covering</li>
      <li>Rainwater Goods</li>
      <li>External Doors and Windows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The exterior finishes may be detailed within the planning consent and will be part of the architect’s design. Cost savings can be achieved if necessary subject to planning consent without compromising the design too much, but this exercise should be undertaken with the help and advice of your architect and Quantity Surveyor. Think about durability and maintenance as well as aesthetics.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Brickwork</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic</li>
      <li>Better</li>
      <li>Best</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here we are considering facing bricks which affect the looks of the project, you may need to match bricks to existing brickwork in an extension or refurb project. Engineering brick is used in load bearing situations and not included here.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Real Stone</h3>
    <p>Natural or Real stone is quarried and often imported increasing the carbon footprint. The choice between natural and cast stone products comes down to personal preference and the constraints of the project, such as time-scales and budgets.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Artificial Stone</h3>
    <p>Reconstituted stone is produced in a mould using cement, limestone, pigments and additives and the finished product closely replicates the natural stone alternative.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Render</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cement</li>
      <li>Lime</li>
      <li>Polymer</li>

      <li>Insulated</li>
      <li>Acrylic</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cement Render</h4>
    <p>This is a cement based one-coat top layer render and needs to be painted.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Lime Render</h4>
    <p>Lime render is flexible and breathable and has a certain finish increasingly sought after.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Polymer Render</h4>
    <p>Polymer ingredients are used to bind this type of render. It can be pre-coloured with near enough any pigment to produce an individual finish.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Monocouche Render</h4>
    <p>This uses cement as a hardening agent, two coats are recommended. It comes in 19 standard through-colours and can be finished smooth or textured to look like stone.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Insulated Render</h4>
    <p>Insulated Render usually refers to an external wall insulation system that not only contains a coloured render, but an insulation material that is adhered to the underlying layer.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Acrylic Render</h4>
    <p>Acrylic ingredients are used to bind this type of render. It tends to be pre-made, arriving on site in tubs – It’s durable, but it can attract algae.</p>
    <hr>

    <hr>
    <h4>Natural Slate</h4>

    <hr>
    <h4>Welsh Slate</h4>
    <p>Expensive but gives an authentic look to period properties.</p>
    <hr>
