    <h1>DGA Plus</h1>
    <p>DGA Plus is a service offering budget-conscious construction clients pre-contract management advice, providing a professional budget estimate based on early-stage architect drawings (RIBA stages 0 and 1).</p>
    <p>This service includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A spreadsheet with “what if” cost analysis and optioneering tools</li>
      <li>Various guides and templates to help clients manage their projects efficiently</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It targets projects between £200,000 and £3,000,000, helping clients who may not have the resources or justification for a full professional team.</p>
    <p>Clients receive a USB containing resources such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Finish on Budget (FoB) model</li>
      <li>Templates</li>
      <li>A video explainer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The FoB model allows users to assess fixed costs and elective finishes, supported by an hour of professional Quantity Surveyor (QS) time. The QS team plays a key role in preparing the budget, based on project specifications, with additional value through advice on cost savings and risk mitigation.</p>
    <p>The service is scalable, with the potential to target 30% of the 350,000 annual planning applications in England, aiming for an initial output of 10 packs per week. To ensure security, templates are stored on Sharepoint. The service adheres to RICS guidelines and operates via a distinct workflow outside DGA’s traditional model, with its own department and leadership planned.</p>
